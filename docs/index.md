# **Background**

I am an applied data scientist with a background in turfgrass science. I have expertise with climate, soil, and geospatial data, as well as computer vision models and large language models.

I'm currently a data scientist at a lawn and garden startup called [Sunday](https://www.getsunday.com/), where I focus on helping customers take better care of their yards. My role involves leveraging deep subject-matter expertise to design, build, and deploy models for customized recommendation systems. More recently, I'm exploring the potential of large language models to improve our customer experience.

Previously, I led turfgrass extension programs at the University of Minnesota and University of California. And way back before that, I did my BS and MS in applied plant science at the University of Minnesota.
